2. Create a book constructor 
3. Add a button that will bring up a form allowing users to input details for the new book
4. Submit the form that will be stored into the book object
5. Create a function that will add book to library

// What I have learned 
- Learning how to create and use constructors 
- Learned how to create classes 
- How to manipulate forms to get its user data 
- Create a form modal 
- Understanding arrays more 

// What I can improve on 
- Plan and map out how code will connect with one anohter
- Add local storage
- Use figma for design
- Creating more specific functions for each individual task
